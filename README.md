# MLNotes
## A collection of handwritten Machine Learning study notes
These are the study notes I took during a 9 months period I spent heavily respecializing towards Machine Learning and Deep Learning on a more or less full time basis. Writing them and using them as flash cards really helped me absorb the knowledge and I am making them available in the hope others will find them just as useful.

They are raw scans of my actual pen & paper notes, no OCR. They're in no way complete or exhaustive: they are intended to be used a study aid / recap notes / flash cards for the relevant books and more in-depth material covering the subjects.

The notes are organized in the following macro areas:

- [Maths](Maths/)

- [Probability & Statistics](Probability/)

- [Machine Learning](Machine Learning/)

- [Reinforcement Learning](Reinforcement Learning/)

- [Deep Learning](Deep Learning/)
