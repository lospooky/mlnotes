#Machine Learning

Here we are, Machine Learning at Last!
These were mainly taken while going through [Machine Learning, A Probabilistic Perspective](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) by Kevin Murphy, so they follow the same general order and organization as the book chapters. Here and there some integrations were made from material taken from [Machine Learning, an Algorithmic Perspective](https://seat.massey.ac.nz/personal/s.r.marsland/MLBook.html) by Stephen Marsland. 

I couldn't recommend these two books nearly enough: in my opinion they provide an overview and outlook of Machine Learning much more modern than the old classics.
I for one, for years had never been able to understand the Kalman Filter posed as a control problem; but it clicked almost instantly when Murphy explains it formalizing it as a Machine Learning problem.
