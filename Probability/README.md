#Probability & Statistics
Before diving into Machine Learning proper, here's some notes about Probability Theory and standard Statistical Methods. If you really want to understand and grasp what any Machine Learning algorithm or model actually does, this is is the place to start,

These notes were put together from a variety of lecture notes from my university courses as well as from [*Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences*](https://www.amazon.com/Probability-Statistics-Engineering-Sciences-Devore/dp/1305251806/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=EP8JTJJ65F7WP5D4KVZX) by Jay L.
