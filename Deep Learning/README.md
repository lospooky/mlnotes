#Deep Learning

Deep Learning, the final frontier... Since 2012 these techniques have had a tremendous impact across all sorts of problems and applications and effectively revolutionized the whole discipline of Machine Learning. 

While countless papers are constantly being published, the only proper textbook currently available is [*Deep Learning*](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by GoodFellow, Bengio, and Courville. I took these notes during the summer of 2015, when they were still finishing the book so they might not reflect the final version; particularly regarding Part 3 of the book.

As someone who's got the luck of working on Deep Learning on a daily basis I have a final word of advice... If you managed this far and were able to understand all of the material, Congratulations! You're now just barely able to understand what's out there and how it works... 

The harsh reality is that from now it'll take you quite some effort to produce your first working model addressing a nontrivial, nontutorial task... Plus the field is still moving so absurdly rapidly that there's at least 2-3 new papers every week that you'll have to read if you want to be on top of your game. 

If all this doesn't scare you but instead it sounds rather exciting, I hope you found these notes useful and I wish you the best of luck for your professional or academic endeavors...
