Oddily enough, Reinforcement Learning is always left out from general Machine Learning Books. The Reinforcement Learning Bible is the seminal book by Sutton and Barto. They're currently writing a much awaited 2nd edition, however these notes are based on the 1st one. Integrations made from Szepesvari.
