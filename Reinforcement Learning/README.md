#Reinforcement Learning

Oddily enough, Reinforcement Learning is always left out from general Machine Learning Books. The Reinforcement Learning Bible is the seminal book by [*Sutton and Barto*](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/the-book.html). They're currently writing a much awaited 2nd edition, however these notes are based on the 1st one.
Additional notes taken from [*Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning*](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~szepesva/RLBook.html) by Csaba Szepesvari.
